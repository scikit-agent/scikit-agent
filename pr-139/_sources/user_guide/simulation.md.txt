# Simulation Guide

This guide covers how to run simulations and analyze results with scikit-agent.

## Running Simulations

Learn how to execute model simulations:

- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Statistical analysis with random sampling
- **Deterministic Simulations**: Controlled scenario analysis
- **Comparative Statistics**: Parameter sensitivity analysis

## Simulation Configuration

Documentation for simulation setup and parameters will be added here.

## Data Collection

Documentation for collecting and organizing simulation results will be added
here.

## Analysis and Visualization

Documentation for analyzing and visualizing simulation output will be added
here.
