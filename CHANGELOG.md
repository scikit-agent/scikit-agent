# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Refactored `BellmanPeriod` with type hints, docstrings, and improved parameter
  handling
- Introduced `_resolve_parameters`, `_resolve_decision_rules`, and
  `_resolve_shocks` helper methods for consistent fallback logic
- Added gradient computation methods (`grad_reward_function`,
  `grad_transition_function`, `grad_pre_state_function`) to `BellmanPeriod`
- Added shock resolution support in `BellmanPeriod` methods
- Moved `compute_gradients_for_tensors` tests from `test_bellman.py` to
  `test_utils.py`
- Introduced `mortality_block` (and `mortal_cons_problem`) to demonstrate how to
  encode stochastic mortality and agent rebirth as a composable `DBlock`.

### Added

- NumFOCUS Code of Conduct adopted
- Created a working `Consumption-Saving Model` example in the documentation
  gallery
- Added a **Benchmark Models** page to the user guide documenting the
  closed-form dynamic-programming benchmarks, with a runnable
  `plot_benchmark_models.py` tour in the models gallery

### Removed

- Removed `AgentTypeMonteCarloSimulator`; mortality is now expressed
  declaratively via `mortality_block` (see Changed). The now-unused
  `calibration_by_age` helper and its API documentation entry were removed with
  it.

### Fixed

- Fixed the `CRRA` calibration in `perfect_foresight_normalized`: it was a
  1-tuple `(2.0,)`, which broke the CRRA utility power; it is now the scalar
  `2.0`.
