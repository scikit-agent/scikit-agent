## Quick Example

```python
import skagent as ska
from skagent.models.consumer import consumption_block, calibration

# Create a consumption-saving model
model = consumption_block
model.construct_shocks(calibration)

# Define simple decision rule
decision_rules = {"c": lambda m: 0.9 * m}

# Run simulation
simulator = ska.MonteCarloSimulator(
    calibration=calibration,
    block=model,
    dr=decision_rules,
    initial={"k": 1.0, "p": 1.0},
    agent_count=1000,
    T_sim=50,
)

results = simulator.simulate()
```

## What Can You Build?

### **Consumption-Saving Models**

- Life-cycle consumption with income uncertainty
- Precautionary saving with borrowing constraints
- Habit formation and durable goods

### **Portfolio Choice Models**

- Mean-variance optimization with labor income
- Multi-asset allocation problems
- Portfolio constraints and transaction costs

### **General Equilibrium Models**

- Overlapping generations models
- Heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks
- Market clearing and equilibrium computation

### **Policy Analysis**

- Tax and transfer policy evaluation
- Social Security and pension reform
- Regulatory impact assessment


## Why scikit-agent?

### 🧱 **Modular Design**

Build complex economic models using intuitive building blocks. Compose **DBlocks** and **RBlocks**
to represent different stages of economic behavior with clear separation of shocks, dynamics,
controls, and rewards.

### 🔬 **Multiple Solution Methods**

Choose from traditional methods like value function iteration or modern neural network approaches.
All algorithms follow consistent APIs and integrate seamlessly with the model framework.

### 📊 **Rich Simulation Engine**

Generate synthetic data with sophisticated Monte Carlo simulators that handle agent heterogeneity,
life-cycle dynamics, and complex stochastic processes.

### 🐍 **Scikit-Learn Compatible**

Familiar fit-predict patterns, consistent APIs, and integration with the broader Python scientific ecosystem.
