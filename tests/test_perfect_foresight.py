"""
Perfect foresight tests for the lifetime reward solver.

Problem addressed:
The lifetime reward solver suffers from shock space explosion with increasing time horizon T.
The loss function creates shock variables for every time period {shock}_{t} for t in range(big_t),
causing the training grid to grow exponentially with T, limiting practical testing to T ≤ 2.

Solution approach:
Perfect foresight models eliminate stochastic shocks entirely, reducing computational
complexity from O(S^T) to O(T) and enabling testing of much larger time horizons.

Mathematical foundation:
    D-1 (Two-period log utility): c₁ = W/(1+β), c₂ = βRW/(1+β)
    D-2 (Finite horizon log utility): cₜ = [(1-β)/(1-β^(T-t+1))] × Wₜ
    D-3 (Infinite horizon CRRA): c = κm where κ = (R-(βR)^(1/σ))/R

Test coverage:
    - Time horizons up to T=500+ (vs previous maximum of T=2)
    - Analytical validation with high precision (typical error ~1e-8)
    - Policy function optimality verification
    - Economic constraint satisfaction (budget constraints, Euler equations)
    - Benchmark model coverage (D-1, D-2, D-3)

This testing framework enables rigorous validation of the lifetime reward solver
across realistic time horizons that were previously computationally infeasible.

    Test suite for lifetime reward solver validation using perfect foresight models.

    This test suite addresses the shock space explosion problem that previously limited
    testing to small time horizons (T ≤ 2).

    Scalability comparison:
        Stochastic models:   T ≤ 2-3     (exponential complexity O(S^T))
        Perfect foresight:   T = 500+    (linear complexity O(T))

    Test categories:
        1. Lifetime reward tests (8 tests):
           - D-1: Two-period log utility with analytical validation
           - D-2: Finite horizon with time-varying consumption rates
           - D-3: Infinite horizon CRRA with convergence testing
           - Edge cases, scalability benchmarks, consistency checks

        2. Policy function tests (3 tests):
           - Optimality condition verification (Euler equations)
           - Budget constraint validation
           - Marginal propensity to consume bounds and feasibility checks

    Mathematical validation:
        - High precision analytical comparison (typical error ~1e-8)
        - Closed-form solution benchmarking
        - Point-wise policy accuracy verification
        - Economic optimality condition satisfaction

    Models tested:
        - D-1: Two-period consumption-savings (baseline case)
        - D-2: Finite horizon log utility (time-varying policies)
        - D-3: Infinite horizon CRRA (canonical consumption model)

    previously computationally infeasible due to shock space explosion.
