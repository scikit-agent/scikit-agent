# Algorithms Guide

This guide covers the solution algorithms and optimization methods available in
scikit-agent.

## Solution Methods

Learn about different approaches to solving economic models:

- **All-in-One Deep Learning Methods** : Deep learning solvers that use an
  All-in-One (AiO) objective function
- **Value Function Iteration**: Classical dynamic programming approaches

## Algorithm Configuration

Documentation for algorithm parameters and settings will be added here.

## Performance Considerations

Documentation for optimization and performance tuning will be added here.
