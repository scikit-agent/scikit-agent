Economic Models
===============

This section contains examples demonstrating how to use and create economic models
with scikit-agent. These examples show how to implement various economic theories
and models using the framework.

Examples include consumption-savings models, portfolio choice problems, and other
standard economic models that can be solved using reinforcement learning and
other computational methods.
