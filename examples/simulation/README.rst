Simulation Examples
===================

This section demonstrates how to run simulations using scikit-agent models.
These examples show how to generate synthetic data, run Monte Carlo simulations,
and analyze the results.

Examples include life-cycle simulations, policy experiments, and sensitivity
analyses that help understand model behavior under different conditions.
