# User Guide

Welcome to the scikit-agent user guide! This comprehensive guide will help you
get started with building, solving, and simulating economic models using
scikit-agent.

## What is scikit-agent?

scikit-agent is a Python package for agent-based economic modeling that follows
scikit-learn conventions. It provides:

**üß± Modular Architecture**: Build models using composable "blocks" that
represent different stages or aspects of economic behavior.

**üî¨ Multiple Solution Methods**: Choose from value function iteration, neural
networks, and other modern computational approaches.

**üìä Rich Simulation Tools**: Generate synthetic data with powerful Monte Carlo
simulators that handle heterogeneity, aging, and complex dynamics.

**üêç Pythonic API**: Familiar patterns for Python users with clear, readable
code.

## Getting Started

## Key Design Principles

### Block-Based Models

Models are composed of **Blocks** that capture:

- **Shocks**: Random variables affecting agents
- **Dynamics**: State transition equations
- **Controls**: Decision variables agents optimize
- **Rewards**: Objective functions to maximize

scikit-agent provides an API for building and reusing model blocks.

### Flexible Calibration

Parameters can be:

- Simple numbers: `"CRRA": 2.0`
- Mathematical expressions: `"utility": "c**(1-gamma)/(1-gamma)"`
- Age-varying sequences: `"income": [1.0, 1.2, 1.1, 0.8]`
