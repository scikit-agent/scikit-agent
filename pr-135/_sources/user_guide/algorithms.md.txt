# Algorithms Guide

This guide covers the solution algorithms and optimization methods available in
scikit-agent.

## Solution Methods

Learn about different approaches to solving economic models:

- **Endogenous Grid Method (EGM)**: Efficient consumption-saving solutions
- **Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK)**: Advanced macroeconomic models
- **Value Function Iteration**: Classical dynamic programming approaches
